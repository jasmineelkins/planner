Designed and built in May 2022 using the concept from my Phase 2 React project at Flatiron School. The goal of this project was to build a Rails project from scratch, and to be able to deploy a usable app on Heroku.

Users of this productivity app can add tasks to their to-do list, which is ranked by priority. Priority level can be updated and tasks can be marked 'complete' or deleted.
In the notes component, users can save notes related to each individual task.

The time tracker component allows users to use a stopwatch to track the amount of time they spend on individual activities.

Clicking on the calendar component allows users to set the 'completed' date for a task. Soon it will allow a user to add tasks to a specific day. Clicking on the button in the top left corner of each component will expand that component to full screen via React Routes; clicking the button from full-screen view will return back to the homepage. The maximized view of the calendar component will show the user's google calendar.
